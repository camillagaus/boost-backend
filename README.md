# Digitalent boilerplate Typescript project

Hi! Odds are, you're seeing this because you are a candidate for Digitalent, and we have sent you one of our cases for you to implement. In order to make things a bit easier for you, we have created this sample project for you to get started.

Nothing is sacred in here: you don't have to use this at all for your case, or you can change the structure completely to how you like it. We like to see how you structure your projects, so if you're a fan of Koa instead of Express, for example, feel free to change to Koa! Or change the Prettier config! Or change to yarn! Or change... You get the gist.

### Swagger with tsoa

There is also a branch in this repo called tsoa, that includes generated swagger documentation at `/docs` where you can test your api out easily. We didn't put it in the main branch as it is a bit opinionated in how you set up your controller, but it's there for you to use if you like it. Tsoa is described more [here.](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa)

## How to get started

```
npm install
npm start
```

You should now have a server running on `http://localhost:8080`

## How to submit

When you're satisfied with your solution, create a pull request to this repo in GitHub, and we can review it together in the next interview!

To make life a bit easier on us, you can also change this README.md to let us know about your solution or anything we need to do on our end to run your code. For instance, if you need a database for your solution, how can we get that up and running?

## Good luck and have fun!
